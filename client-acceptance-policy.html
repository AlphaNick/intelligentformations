Bank account opening fees only relate to Companies incorporated by IFL and not by other Corporate Service Providers. IFL only act at all times as an introduction service to banks and cannot be held responsible for any client applications that have been refused.

            <p>5.9 Intelligent Formations Limited may use a UK company as agent for the collection of fees for services. This arrangement does not affect the terms set out in this Client Acceptance Policy.</p>
